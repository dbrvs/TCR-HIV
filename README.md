# TCR-HIV
Codebase for accepted manuscript: Mild HIV-specific selective forces overlaying natural CD4+ T cell dynamics explain the clonality and decay dynamics of HIV reservoir cells.

Code is ipython notebooks which can be opened for example with visual studio code to see code and figures. Notebooks were used to analyze data and are named based on the figure they generated. The clonesim_module.py is loaded and run in notebooks to perform the branching process simulation. Note, raw data files are very large (300MB each) so to rerun TCR analysis, data must be shared by Dr Antar via Adaptive Biotechnology.
